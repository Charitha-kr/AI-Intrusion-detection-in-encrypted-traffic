## 🔐 Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) using AI

This project is a deep learning-based Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) built to detect malicious network traffic in real-time. It utilizes a **hybrid Conv1D + LSTM model** to classify traffic as normal or intrusive. The model is trained on the **CICIDS2017 dataset**, which contains realistic network traffic simulating attacks and normal behavior.

---

### 📌 Problem Statement

As the volume and complexity of cyberattacks grow, traditional signature-based IDS systems struggle to detect novel threats. This project aims to:

* Identify known and unknown intrusion patterns using AI.
* Provide real-time classification of network traffic.
* Enable scalable and efficient intrusion detection suitable for deployment in modern infrastructure.

---

### 🧠 Architecture

* **Data Preprocessing:**

  * Dataset: [CICIDS2017](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2017.html)
  * Normalization and handling of missing values.
  * Categorical encoding and feature selection.

* **Model Architecture:**

  ```
  Input → Conv1D → LSTM → Dense → Output
  ```

  * Conv1D: Captures spatial dependencies in the traffic sequence.
  * LSTM: Learns temporal patterns in traffic behavior.
  * Output: Binary classification (Normal or Attack)

* **Technologies Used:**

  * Python
  * TensorFlow / Keras
  * Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
  * Wireshark/Scapy/PyShark for live packet capture (optional for future extension)
